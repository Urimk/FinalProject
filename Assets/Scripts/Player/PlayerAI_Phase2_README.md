### **2. Improved Episode Termination**
- **Robust End Conditions**: Better handling of different episode end scenarios
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper timeout management with detailed logging
- **Episode State Validation**: Prevents duplicate episode endings
- **Graceful Termination**: Clean episode shutdown with proper cleanup

### **3. Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
- **Detailed Episode Outcomes**: Comprehensive logging of episode results
- **Performance Statistics**: Real-time episode performance tracking
- **Boss Mode Integration**: Logging includes current boss mode information
- **Debug Information**: Rich debugging data for analysis

### **4. Better EpisodeManager Integration**
- **Modular Boss Support**: Works with all EpisodeManager boss modes
- **Null Safety**: Robust handling when EpisodeManager is not available
- **Episode Statistics**: Access to episode performance data
- **Timeout Integration**: Proper timeout handling through EpisodeManager

## New Features

### **Episode Statistics Tracking**
```csharp
// Episode duration tracking
private float _episodeStartTime = 0f;
private float _episodeDuration = 0f;

// Damage tracking
private int _episodeDamageTaken = 0;
private int _episodeDamageDealt = 0;

// Episode state
private bool _episodeEnded = false;
```

### **Enhanced Episode Initialization**
```csharp
public override void OnEpisodeBegin()
{
    // Reset episode tracking
    _episodeStartTime = Time.time;
    _episodeDuration = 0f;
    _episodeDamageTaken = 0;
    _episodeDamageDealt = 0;
    _episodeEnded = false;
    
    // Enhanced logging with boss mode info
    Debug.Log($"[PlayerAI] Episode {EpisodeManager.Instance.EpisodeCount + 1} starting - Boss Mode: {EpisodeManager.Instance.CurrentBossMode}");
}
```

### **Improved Episode Termination**
```csharp
public void HandlePlayerDamaged(float damage)
{
    if (_isPlayerDead || _isBossDefeated || _episodeEnded) return;
    
    // Track episode damage
    _episodeDamageTaken++;
    
    // Check for death
    if (_playerHealth.CurrentHealth <= 0)
    {
        _episodeEnded = true;
        _episodeDuration = Time.time - _episodeStartTime;
        
        // Log detailed outcome
        LogEpisodeOutcome("Player Death", damage);
        
        // Record with EpisodeManager
        EpisodeManager.Instance?.RecordEndOfEpisode(bossWon: true);
        EndEpisode();
    }
}
```

### **Timeout Handling**
```csharp
public void HandleEpisodeTimeout()
{
    if (_episodeEnded) return;
    
    _episodeEnded = true;
    _episodeDuration = Time.time - _episodeStartTime;
    
    // Log timeout outcome
    LogEpisodeOutcome("Timeout", 0f);
    
    // Apply timeout penalty and end episode
    AddReward(_penaltyLose);
    EpisodeManager.Instance?.RecordEndOfEpisode(bossWon: true);
    EndEpisode();
}
```

### **Episode Statistics Access**
```csharp
public string GetEpisodeStatistics()
{
    float currentDuration = Time.time - _episodeStartTime;
    string bossModeInfo = EpisodeManager.Instance != null ? 
        $"Boss Mode: {EpisodeManager.Instance.CurrentBossMode}" : "Boss Mode: Unknown";
    
    return $"[PlayerAI] Episode Statistics:" +
           $"\n  Duration: {currentDuration:F2}s" +
           $"\n  Damage Taken: {_episodeDamageTaken}" +
           $"\n  Damage Dealt: {_episodeDamageDealt}" +
           $"\n  Episode Ended: {_episodeEnded}" +
           $"\n  {bossModeInfo}";
}
```

## Episode Outcome Logging

### **Detailed Episode Logs**
Each episode now provides comprehensive logging including:
- **Episode Number**: Current episode count
- **Outcome**: How the episode ended (Player Death, Boss Defeated, Timeout)
- **Duration**: How long the episode lasted
- **Damage Statistics**: Damage taken and dealt
- **Boss Mode**: Current EpisodeManager boss mode
- **Final Damage**: The damage value that triggered episode end

### **Example Log Output**
```
[PlayerAI] Episode 15 ended - Boss Defeated
  Duration: 23.45s
  Damage Taken: 2
  Damage Dealt: 8
  Final Damage: 0
  Boss Mode: Auto
```

## Integration with Modular EpisodeManager

### **Boss Mode Support**
- **QLearning Mode**: Full integration with Q-learning boss and reward system
- **Auto Mode**: Works with simple auto boss behavior
- **None Mode**: Functions without any boss present

### **EpisodeManager Integration**

- **Episode Recording**: Proper episode end recording for all modes
- **Environment Reset**: Supports all boss mode reset requirements
- **Timeout Integration**: Proper timeout handling through EpisodeManager

## Benefits

### **Better Learning**
- **Detailed Feedback**: Rich episode outcome information for analysis
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor AI performance over time
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Episode Analysis**: Better understanding of AI behavior patterns

### **Robust Operation**
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents duplicate episode endings
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works even when EpisodeManager is unavailable
- **State Management**: Better episode state tracking

- **Easy Analysis**: Comprehensive episode statistics for analysis

## Usage Examples

### **Accessing Episode Statistics**
```csharp
// Get current episode statistics
string stats = playerAI.GetEpisodeStatistics();
Debug.Log(stats);
```

### **Monitoring Episode Performance**
```csharp
// Check episode duration during training
if (Time.time - episodeStartTime > maxEpisodeDuration)
{
    Debug.LogWarning("Episode taking too long!");
}
```

### **Debugging Episode Issues**
```csharp
// Log episode statistics for debugging
Debug.Log($"[PlayerAI] Episode {episodeCount} - Damage Taken: {damageTaken}, Damage Dealt: {damageDealt}");
```

## Migration from Phase 1
